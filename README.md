Clarification: Taking babysteps here. Which means, that I will have some issues solving some coding stuff and also take my time to finish the project. 
After clearifying that, lets get to it:

The main idea is to create a *sphere* structure with *nodes* on it. Each node shuold display its name on hover and be clickable. They should redirect to a corresponding entry (blog post or something like that).

the sphere:
- it will be translucent or totally transparent (not sure yet)
- contains the *nodes* on its surface
- is grabbable with the mouse to spin around
- you should be able to zoom in and contemplate the sphere and existing nodes from the "inside"

the nodes:
- my inspiration comes form OBSIDIAN.md
- I'd like to design these nodes in a similar way
- they are deployed on the surface of the base structure (sphere) and get the same color code if they have the same *tag*
- some of them (same tag and a maximum distance) should also share a visible connection (a line which also appears on the surface of the base structure)

the tag:
- a way to group the nodes by color
