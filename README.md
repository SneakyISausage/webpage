The main idea is to create a *sphere* structure with *nodes* on it.

the sphere:
- it will be translucent or totally transparent (not sure yet)
- contains the *nodes* on its surface
- is grabbable with the mouse to spin around

the nodes:
- my inspiration comes form OBSIDIAN.md
- I'd like to design these nodes in a similar way
- they are deployed on the surface of the base structure (sphere) and get the same color code if they have the same *tag*

the tag:
- a way to group the nodes by color
